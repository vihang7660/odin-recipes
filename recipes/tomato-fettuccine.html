            A lightened up version of the Cheesecake Factory's® creamy sun-dried tomato fettuccine pasta dish.

        <p>
            Fettuccine al dente is combined with rich cream, fresh taste of tomatoes, tangy flavor of garlic and onion, and topped with delicious parmesan. Yum! This in-season-anytime-of-the-year Pasta with Tomato Cream Sauce is an easy hit with everyone at home.

            Summer holiday is over and busy days have already taken over. This time of the year I usually need to cook something quick and something that will easily attract the folks at home to the dining table. Sometimes I’m really short on time and I need something as fast as5-ingredient parmesan pasta. Or this tomato sauce pasta recipe rushes to help in times like those if I have 15 mins to cook. Both are really easy to make.

            <li>¾ pound dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogur</li>
            <li>¼ cup reduced-fat sour crea</li>
            <li>½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, sliced</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1½ cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water, and set noodles aside.
            </li>
            <li>Mix together Greek yogurt and sour cream in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and mix in diced tomatoes, sugar, and tomato paste. Stir until well combined. Whisk in yogurt mixture swiftly. You'll want to slowly add it in, but whisk fast to get it all incorporated well. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce starts to thicken, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add baby spinach to sauce and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add cooked fettuccine and remove skillet from heat. Toss to coat pasta with sauce. If sauce seems too thick, thin with some of the reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Top with crushed red pepper to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
